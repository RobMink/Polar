Polar Printer
This is an unfinished Polar Printer, Demo-ed at ERRF 2019

it needs firmware work for homing xy and a better belt system.

I used a 100-1 gear reduced stepper or a belt driven stepper system, as long as no backlash is in the system it will work well.  Also, if going with a reduced stepper, use around a 25 to one instead of a 100 to one.
